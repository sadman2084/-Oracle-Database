a.	Create a PROFILE named Password_Management where PASSWORD LIFE TIME will be 10 days, PASSWORDGRACETIME will be 8 days, PASSWORD REUSE MAX will be 3, PASSWORDLOCKTIME will for 1 day, FAILEDLOGIN ATTEMPTS for 2 times, PASSWORDREUSETIME 10 day. Prove each profile by appropriate comment execution. Submit the consequent execution comment in text file. Also show the comment for showing your created profile.   							
b.	To prevent a password from being reused, you can use one of two profile parameters: PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX or PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME. ‘These two parameters are mutually exclusive; if you set a value for one of them, the other must not be set to UNLIMITED’-justify the statement.

b.
Oracle provides two methods to prevent password reuse: PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX and PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME. PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX determines the number of different passwords a user must use before they can reuse an old one, while PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME specifies the number of days that must pass before an old password can be reused. 

These two parameters cannot be used together because they address different aspects of password management. Using both could lead to conflicts or confusion in enforcing password policies.

To avoid this, Oracle enforces a rule where if PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX is set to a specific value, PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME must not be set to UNLIMITED and vice versa. This ensures a clear and consistent password security policy, eliminating any potential conflicts.
